https://yesterdays-news-hn.netlify.app

Hosted using Netlify.

## Project Summary
Yesterday's News is a well-designed, content-focussed article website with reddit-like functionality. Users can view articles and associated comments, and also have the ability to view articles from particular topics and sort based on date, title, user, and votes. Once logged-in, users can post their own articles, topics and comments. Logged-in users can also show their support (or dissent) by voting on each of the articles and comments.

The website features a fun, modern design that works well on both mobile screens and desktop displays. Developed using the React library, React Hooks, and best practices ranging from SOLID to the WC Accessibility Guidelines.

Try it out by exploring the website for yourself!
